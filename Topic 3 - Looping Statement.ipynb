To know whether the given number is Palindrome or not, first, we need to reverse the number. and after that if the reversed value is equals to the original value than the given number is Palindrome. Here, we have stored \"i\" into \"x\" as in reverse logic the i value becomes \"0\" in the end so after the reversed operation is done i becomes \"0\" and then there will be no original value stored in n as it becomes 0. So to compare the reverse value with original value we have used x which stores the original value.The // operator is used for integer division, and the % operator is used to get the remainder when the number is divided by 10."
