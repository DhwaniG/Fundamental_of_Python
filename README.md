# Theroy 1 : Python
Python is a popular high-level programming language that was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a simple and clear syntax that makes it an ideal language for beginners. Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Python is also an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed directly without the need for compilation, making it a fast and efficient language for development.Python is an open-source language, which means that it is freely available to download and use, and it has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development. This has led to the creation of many third-party libraries and frameworks that extend the capabilities of Python and make it even more versatile and powerful.
