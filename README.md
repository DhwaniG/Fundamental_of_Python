I am Learning Python Program under the course 'Data Analytics' from Edubridge learning pvt. ltd.
This Repository have all the Assignments of fundamental of python.

# Theory 1 - Python
Python is a popular high-level programming language that was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a simple and clear syntax that makes it an ideal language for beginners. Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Python is also an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed directly without the need for compilation, making it a fast and efficient language for development.Python is an open-source language, which means that it is freely available to download and use, and it has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development. This has led to the creation of many third-party libraries and frameworks that extend the capabilities of Python and make it even more versatile and powerful.

# Theory 2 - File Handling
File handling is the process of working with files in a computer system. This involves reading from, writing to, and manipulating files on disk. In Python, file handling is achieved using built-in functions and methods that are part of the standard library.
To open a file in Python, the built-in function open() is used. This function takes two arguments - the name of the file to open and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be either "r" for reading, "w" for writing, or "a" for appending to the end of the file. 

# Theory 3 - Exception Handling
Exception handling is the process of anticipating and handling errors or unexpected events that can occur during the execution of a program. In Python, exceptions are raised when an error or an unexpected condition occurs during program execution, such as a division by zero or trying to access a file that doesn't exist.
The try-except block is used for exception handling in Python. The code that may raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and the code that should be executed if an exception is raised is placed inside the except block.

# Theory 4 - OOPs
OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. The objects are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of the objects.OOPs allows for code to be organized into logical, reusable pieces, making it easier to maintain and update as the program grows. It also encourages encapsulation, which is the practice of keeping the implementation details of an object hidden from other parts of the program, which can help to reduce complexity and improve code quality.
